# 一. blockquote元素

`blockquote`元素表示引自他处的一片内容。该元素的用途与`q`元素类似，但是通常用在要引用的内容更多的情况下。

## 1. 元素信息

| 元素       | 元素类型 | 允许具有的父元素         | 局部属性 | 内容   | 标签用法           |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| blockquote | 流       | 任何可以包含流元素的元素 | cite     | 流内容 | 开始标签和结束标签 |

| 是否为HTML5新增 | 在HTML5中的变化 | 习惯样式                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 否              | 无              | <pre><code>blockquote {<br />    display: block;<br />    margin-before: 1em;<br />    margin-after: 1em;<br />    margin-start: 40px;<br />    margin-end: 40px;<br />}</code></pre> |

## 2. 使用元素

该元素的`cite`属性可以用来指定所引用的内容的来源。

```html
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">
An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
</blockquote>
```

其渲染效果如下：
